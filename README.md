## ID Assignment 1
This website is designed for future employers and interviewers of Lim Xiang. This website will include a description of Lim Xiang's personality, his education history, awards, accolades. It will showcase his skills, projects and assignment done. It will provide necessary contact information for future employers to contact Lim Xiang. The aim of this project is to create a responsive webpage to provide necessary details to these future employers and interviewers to make their decision.

## Design Process
This website is for future employers and interviewer of Lim Xiang. These employers and interviewers would most likely want to find out what Lim Xiang has done while he was in school, his skills, his personality, to determine
whether he is a suitable candidate for what he applies in the future. These project will help to collate all these information into one responsive website showcasing Lim Xiang's skills, personality, hobby, education level, projects involved and completed, so that it is easy for interviewer to get the information.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As an employer, I would like to know more about Lim Xiang's education level, skills, project, so that I can determine if he would be a suitable employee in my company.
As an interviewer, I would like to know more about Lim Xiang's character, hobby, projects, skillset, so that I can determine if he would be suitable to enter my school, to get this scholarship.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
