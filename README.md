# Resume

## ID Assignment 1

This website is designed for my future employers and interviewers. This website will include a description of my personality, education history, awards, accolades. It will showcase my skills, projects and assignment done. It will provide necessary contact information for future employers to contact me. The aim of this project is to create a responsive webpage to provide necessary details to these future employers and interviewers to make their decision.

## Design Process

This website is for my future employers and interviewer. These employers and interviewers would most likely want to find out what I have done while I was in school, my skills, my personality, to determine
whether I am a suitable candidate for what I applied in the future. These project will help to collate all these information into one responsive website showcasing my skills, personality, hobby, education level, projects involved and completed, so that it is easy for interviewer to get the information.

As an employer, I would like to know more about Lim Xiang's education level, skills, project, so that I can determine if he would be a suitable employee in my company.
To make this accessible, one page will be designed to contain all the information relating to my education.

As an interviewer, I would like to know more about Lim Xiang's character, hobby, projects, skillset, so that I can determine if he would be suitable to enter my school, to get this scholarship.
To make this accessible, one page will be designed solely for my personal information.
